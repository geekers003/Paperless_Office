## What is a workflow management system ? ##
 A workflow management system (WfMS or WFMS) provides an infrastructure for the set-up,
 performance and monitoring of a defined sequence of tasks, arranged as a workflow application.
 Workflow management is creating and optimizing the paths for data in order to complete items in a given process. Workflow management includes mapping out the workflow in an ideal state, finding redundant tasks, automating the process, and identifying bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
 A workflow management system (WMS or WfMS) is a software tool designed to help streamline routine business processes for optimal efficiency. Workflow management systems involve creating a form to hold data and setting a sequential path of tasks for the data to follow until it is fully processed.  It will automatically route the data to the predetermined tasks.

 ## Paperless_Office ##
 We follow the System Design as shown above . In our very first version of the Paperless_Office - a customizable Workflow       System  we added follwing features :- 
 *  __Grade-1 user__ can see the tasks assigned to him by his manager  with a fixed deadline by the sender.
 *  __Grade-1 user__ can send documents to his manager for the very first approval. He can also see the approved documents by     his    Grade-2 user (__ususally Manager__),and can see the status of his request in the complete process.
 * For __Garde-2 user__ , he can approve the request of the grade-1 user within a period of two days otherwise it will be send to next level automatically  and this request will eventually send to the senior    level executieve or __Grade-3 user__.
 * After __approval___ of __top level user__ this document will be digitally signed and again send the Complete Status to the Grade-2 as well as Grade-1 user from where this request was geneated.
 * users can interact with other users as well and send  message to thier higher level authorities as well.
 *  user converssation is __totally encrypted__ so its secure between two points.

##  Essential Features that our Worlflow System has ##
1. Simple to use with one click access to everything .
2. Access control: Different people have different access needs
3. Cloud based: Easy access, anywhere, anytime
4. Transparency: Easily find the information you need, when you need it
